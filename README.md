Mokhtar Z. Alaya, Olga Klopp. Collective Matrix Completion. See preprint [arXiv:1807.09010v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09010).

The PLAIS-Impute algorithm presented in the paper is an adaption of the [AIS-Impute algorithm](https://github.com/quanmingyao/AIS-impute) in [Accelerated inexact soft-impute for fast large-scale matrix completion](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/15/Papers/562.pdf) by [Q. Yao](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~qyaoaa/) and J. T. Kwok, in *Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), Buenos Aires, Argentina, Jul 2015*.
